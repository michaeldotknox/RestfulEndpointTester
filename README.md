A framework to make it easier to test RESTful endpoints using the syntax similar to what you would use when writing unit tests.

More documentation is coming soon.

To get started, install the NuGet package in your test project.  Create your tests using the sample test project as an example.  To run the tests, create a console application, initialize the tests and run them.  See the TestRunner project as an example.  The TestSuite component will search for assemblies with tests in the current directory.
